# A Basic Feedforward Neural Network

I wrote this code while I was still in grad school and learining about deep learning.
I wanted to really _understand_ how neural networks work, so I wrote my own.  It's
obviously not very performant, but that's not the point.  I took a lot of direction from
the Coursera course [Machine Learning] by Andrew Ng (highly recommended: in my opinion,
the only online ML course that balances theory and brevity well).
